# Code-Clicker-Game
Code Clicker is a small game I am making in HTML, CSS and JS. It's very simple as well!<br />
You click the JS logo to get your currency. In this case, its code.<br />

You use code to buy upgrades, be it idle upgrades that add to your money per second, or multipliers that make the idle ones make more, and even one where you click it, and get more code with each click! It is currently in progress, and is very small, with more than 270 lines of code right now but its constantly being updated. Hopefully soon i can give it a domain so that people can play it.<br />

<b>If you want to play it!</b><br />
You will need to copy and paste the html/js file's contents into a text editor, such as notepad.<br />
If you want to see the page's actual style, in the html, add the tag <style></style> and paste the css there.<br />
Or save the html file, and the css file to desktop. Name the css file clickerGame2.css
